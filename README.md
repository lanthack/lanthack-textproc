# Text Processing

This code was developed as a part of a one-day [LaNT hackathon](http://lanthack.org). 

## Aim
Investigate stronger relationships between word vectors.
For example, the base, comparative, and superlative forms have a natural directional interrelationship. We wish to investigate if currently available word vectors possess these relationships.

## Datasets
We use pre-trained [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) word vectors available under Public Domain Dedication and License.
